                        <p><strong><span>Speech intelligibility:</span></strong><span> The fundamental tone of female
                                voices is typically 200Hz - 220Hz. The fundamental tone of male voices is 100Hz - 120Hz.
                                The most important freq range for inteligibility in english is 2kHz. A more in-depth

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong><span>Start with too much</span></strong><span>: Its faster to make adjustments by
                                going past what sounds good and then dialing it back into acceptable range. The human
                                brain responds better to higher contrast, so instead of gradually and incrementingly
                                making changes and trying to decide if your changes are effective, it becomes much more
                                obvious when you make bigger changes and then correct to acceptable values.</span></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong><span>Beware ear fatigue</span></strong><span>: Listening to the same sound over and
                                over again ruins your perspective on how something sounds. Always have another bit of
                                audio to compare too. Example: Record some audio, listen back, listen to another bit of
                                audio that&#39;s comparable (not in volume but in timbre), listen to yours, make
                                adjustments, repeat until happy.</span></p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong><span>High-pass filter (hp) / low cut filter</span></strong><span>: Mics pick up
                                everything that makes noise. The truck that rolled past your house, the subs your
                                neighboors are blasting, the electrical hum your wires pick up, the sound of air hitting
                                the mic, and so much more, your mic picks up all of it. Using a high-pass / low-cut
                                filter to cut out the freq you aren&#39;t using ensures that that feq space is available
                                for other things (explosions ffrom games, lowend from music, etc). Its a best practice
                                to cut below the fundemental of your voice so that toggling the hp filter on &amp; off
                                makes no noticible difference to your voice.</span></p>

                        <p><strong><span>Mic position:</span></strong><span> All microphones have different frequency
                                responses based on your distance to the microphone. The most prominent effect of this is
                                how much bass freq your voice has when you get closer to the mic vs far away. The only
                                thing that really matters here is consistency. By maintaing a consistent distance from
                                the mic you can guarantee a consistent sound.</span></p>

                        <p><strong><span>Gain:</span></strong><span> Once you have your mic at a comfortable distance
                                adjust the gain of the bridge caster till your peaks are in the yellow. </span></p>

                                    is the frequency response for the sm7b</span></a><span>. You can see from the chart
                                the highend drops around 10Khz. This makes the mic naturally dull, so you need to
                                brighten it up by boosting high freq&#39;s.</span></p>
